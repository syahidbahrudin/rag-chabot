#  Project Update: What Actually Changed (Human Version)

## 1 Backend Glow-Up

### 🧠 RAG Engine Got a Whole Upgrade

* Qdrant connection? Now it actually tells you what's going on (with emojis).
* If Qdrant is down, it doesn’t panic—just falls back to in-memory mode.
* Retrieving docs now includes `_score`, uses better filtering, and handles IDs properly.
* Prompt system got a makeover: clearer instructions, friendly tone, markdown, bigger context window.
* Added streaming support so answers pop in real-time.

### 🤖 LLM Integration

* Prompt system is now way smarter + cleaner.
* Temperature bumped up → responses feel more natural.
* Added a `generate_stream()` method for real-time replies.
* Bigger `max_tokens` for longer answers.

### 🌐 API Endpoints

* `/api/ask/stream` → New streaming endpoint using SSE.
* Better health check → now tells you if Qdrant is alive or dead.
* Citation filtering improved so results aren’t messy.

### ⚙ Settings

* `.env` actually loads now.
* Added `QDRANT_URL` setting with smart defaults.
* Default LLM provider is now OpenAI instead of that “stub” placeholder.

# 🚀 TL;DR (Ultra Human Version)

You basically:

- Turned the backend from “barely works” → “production-vibes.”
- Upgraded UI from “basic chat box” → “modern AI assistant experience.”
- Added sweet features like streaming, markdown, dashboard, citations.
- Cleaned up Docker, configs, logging, and settings.
- Reduced jank across the whole codebase.

Everything still works with old endpoints, so no breaking stuff.
